### Hi there üëã

I am currently a 4th year student at Polytech Montpellier (a highly selective Engineering School in the South of France), preparing a 5-year Engineering qualification in Computer Science and Management (equivalent to a master‚Äôs degree in Engineering).

Our qualification, a ‚Äúdipl√¥me d'ing√©nieur‚Äù, is fully recognized by the French National Engineering Audit Commission (CTI) and classes in both theoretical and practical subjects prepare us for future careers in a variety of domains related to Computer Science and Management, such as information system design and analysis, software engineering, databases, programming languages, mobile and web application development.

As our school places much importance on education directly applied to professional experience, each student completes a variety of work experience placements in firms throughout the course.

**Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.**
