### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Ambition, drive and hard-work, those are the three pillars I stand by day-to-day. 

After obtaining a perfect score on the National French BaccalaurÃ©at, I undertook two years of rigorous and relentless Maths and Physics training where I discovered a passion for Software Development and Computer Science, which led me to succeed in a competitive examination which allowed me to join the highly selective Master of Engineering program at Polytech Montpellier, where I am now studying Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, Computer Science and Management.
